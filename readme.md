# RocketCoder
RocketCoder can generate entire programs for you just based off of your prompt.
It is powered by Google's free tier AI API models. And it can browse the web for up to date info (Not finished yet)

It can not only make the files, write to them but also install all the needed requirements and even run the program. Actually, if you asked it very kindly ( and also have the ./sandbox connected to a git repo ) it could even push for you.

Once it is finished, it will give you a summary of what it did.

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

`python RocketCoder.py`
